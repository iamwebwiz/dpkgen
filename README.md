## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - this also installs `npm`

## Setup

Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/iamwebwiz/dpkgen.git
```

Change current directory to cloned repo

```shell
cd dpkgen
```

Run the following to install dependencies of the project: `npm install`

## Testing

To run the tests use `npm test`

If you are using **yarn**, swap out **npm** in the commands above for **yarn** and you'd be good to go
