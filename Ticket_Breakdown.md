# Ticket Breakdown

## Ticket 1

**Allow a facility to generate custom ids for each agents**

As a facility manager, I should be able to run a function, which lets me create a custom ID for an agent working in my facility

As a developer, I want to create a function `generateAgentIdForFacility(agentId: number|string, facilityId: number|string, customId: string)`. Also, I need to create a new table which will map a facility with an agent and the custom Id for that agent. A pivot table name `agent_facility` with the following schema can be used:

```ts
AgentFacility {
  agent_id: number|string;
  facility_id: number|string;
  custom_id: string;
}
```

I also want to create a function `agentFacilityMappingExists(agentId: number|string, facilityId: number|string)` which checks for the existence of a mapping between the agent and facility and returns a boolean.

When the `generateAgentIdForFacility()` function is run, it should verify that a mapping does not already exist between the facility and the agent using the `agentFacilityMappingExists()` function above, in the case of a falsy response, create a new record in the table using the parameters supplied to the `generateAgentIdForFacility()` function.

### Effort required

Medium

### Time estimate

2 hours

### Acceptance criteria

- Once the function to generate the custom id is run, the custom id is populated in the pivot table
- There are no duplicate records of the facility and the agent

## Ticket 2

**Refactor the getShiftsByFacility(facilityId) function**

As a developer, I want to refactor the `getShiftsByFacility(facilityId: number|string)` function such that the metadata of the agent that is returned with each shift contains their custom id for that facility to be used in generating the report.

Each returned `Shift` object should look like this:

```ts
Shift {
    // ...existing shift data
    agent: {
        // ...previous metadata
        customId: string|null; // the custom ID of the agent for that facility
    }
}
```

### Effort required

Simple

### Time estimate

1 hour

### Acceptance criteria

- Running this function against a shift with an agent that has a custom id generated by the facility should return the custom id of the agent as part of the agent metadata for that shift
- If there's no mappping between the agent and facility, the `customId` property should be null

## Ticket 3

**Refactor the generateReport(Shift[]) function**

As a developer, I want to refactor the `generateReport(Shift[])` function such that it puts into consideration the optional customId of the agent for a shift. Use a ternary operator to determine which id to use on the report - if the customId of the agent exists, use that, otherwise, the internal database id would suffice (this is for facilities that are yet/decide not to create a custom id for the agent).

### Effort required

Simple

### Time estimate

30 minutes

### Acceptance criteria

- Running this function against a shift with an agent that has a custom id generated by the facility should display the custom id of the agent on the PDF report generated for the shift for compliance.
- For backward compatibility, ensure that if a custom ID is not generated for an agent yet, the internal database id should be displayed on the PDF
